__*A data analysis of shark attacks records*__

## Description

### What

* This project intends to show a way of __*cleaning, exploring and visualizing*__ a kaggle dataset.
* Due to the messy dataset and the lack of previous knowledge of the subject, there will be no initial hypothesis. 
* Thus the final outcome of this work is expected to generate insights and hypothesis that could be tested in a future study.

### How

* The dataset manipulation and cleaning will be implemented on a jupyter notebook.
* The visualizations will be displayed using streamlit library.

### Why

* The biggest motivation of this work is to enhance my Python skills.

## Usage

After running the jupyter-notebook script *__"SharkAttack"__*

Currently (March 2021), there is an installation issue with Python 3.9 and Streamlit.
