## What

* This project intends to show a way of __*cleaning, exploring and visualizing*__ a kaggle dataset.

* Due to the messy dataset and the lack of previous knowledge of the subject, there will be no initial hypothesis. 

* Thus the final outcome of this work is expected to generate insights and hypothesis that could be tested in a future study.

## How

* The dataset manipulation and cleaning will be implemented on a jupyter notebook.

* The visualizations will be displayed using streamlit library.

## Why

* The biggest motivation of this work is to enhance my Python skills.
